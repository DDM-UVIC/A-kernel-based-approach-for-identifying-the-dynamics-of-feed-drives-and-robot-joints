The "codes.rar" file contains the MATLAB code and experimental data used in the paper entitled "A-kernel-based-approach-for-identifying-the-dynamics-of-feed-drives-and-robot-joints". There are separate folders for two case studies (X) discussed in the paper (robot joint and CNC feed drive). In each folder, there is an "X_identification.mat" for the partially linear support vector machine (PL-LSSVM) regression and identification algorithm, and an "X_optimization" for genetic algorithm (GA) hyperparameter optimization of the PL-LSSVM algorithm. There are secondary code files in the folders that are explained in the comment sections of the codes.
